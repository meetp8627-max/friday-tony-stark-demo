# Android Agent Starter

This is a starter template for [LiveKit Agents](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/overview/) that provides a simple voice interface using the [LiveKit Android SDK](https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-android).

This template is free for you to use or modify as you see fit.

## Getting started

The easiest way to get this app running is with the [LiveKit CLI](https://docs.livekit.io/home/cli/cli-setup/). Run the following command to automatically clone this template and connect it to LiveKit Cloud:

```bash
lk app create --template agent-starter-android
```

Build and run the app in Android Studio.

The app is configured to connect to the LiveKit homepage agent by default, which you can also try at [livekit.com](https://www.livekit.com). To point the app at your own agent, see [Connect to your agent](#connect-to-your-agent).

> [!NOTE]
> To set up without the LiveKit CLI, clone the repository via git.

## Connect to your agent

To switch from the default agent to your own, you first need a LiveKit agent to speak with. For a no-code setup, use the [Agent Builder](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/builder/). For more customization, try our starter agent for [Python](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-python), [Node.js](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-node), or [create your own from scratch](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/voice-ai/).

Second, you need a token server. For development, the easiest option is the development token server. Read our [docs](https://docs.livekit.io/frontends/build/authentication/development-token-server/) on how to activate it for you project. 

Then edit `TokenExt.kt`:

```kotlin
const val tokenServerId = "your token server id"
```

## Token generation

In a production environment, you will be responsible for developing a solution to [generate tokens for your users](https://docs.livekit.io/home/server/generating-tokens/) which is integrated with your authentication solution. You should disable the token server and modify `TokenExt.kt` to use your own token server.
